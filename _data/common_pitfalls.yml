- title: Misleading variable naming in set comprehension
  explanation: |
    **Problem:** The expression

    ```
    {(v, v). v ∈ {''a'', ''b''}}
    ```
    
    is actually interpreted as

    ```
    {(va ∷ 'a, v ∷ char list). v ∈ {''a'', ''b''}}
    ```

    **Fix**: Write

    ```
    {(v, v) | v. v ∈ {''a'', ''b''}}
    ```
